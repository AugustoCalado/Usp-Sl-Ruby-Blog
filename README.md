### Controller

A controller is simply a class that is defined to inherit from ApplicationController. It's inside this class that you'll define methods that will become the actions for this controller.

#### How to generate controllers in ruby

```
rails generate controller Welcome index

```

### Routing File
In the **config/routes.br** we define how to connect incoming requests to controllers and actions.


### Resource
A resource is the term used for a collection of similar objects, such as articles, people, or animals.

Rails provides a resources method which can be used to declare a standard REST resource.

```

Rails.application.routes.draw do

 resources :articles

end

```

### Acessing URL Params

```
 Let's consider an example URL: http://www.example.com/?username=dhh&email=dhh@email.com. In this URL, params[:username] would equal "dhh" and params[:email] would equal "dhh@email.com".
```
